## Week 2 - Deep Neural Networks for Time Series

### Preparing features and labels

* Feature/Input, X  - a number of values we are taking i.e. the window / sample data
* Label,  y - the next value in the series after the Input data

See the `Preparing Features and Labels` Colab notebook for the TensorFlow implementation of creating datasets, windowing, truncating,  shuffling and  batching using numpy, TF and lambda functions.



### Feeding windowed dataset into neural network

See the `Single Layer NN with Time Series` Colab notebook and videos.
